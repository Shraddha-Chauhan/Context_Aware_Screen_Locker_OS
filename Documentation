Screen Locker Dashboard: User Management Interface [GUI]

> The web-based GUI serves as the administrative dashboard for the Context-Aware Screen Locker. 
> Its primary function is to manage the list of authorized users whose faces the system will recognize for controlling access to the device.

> The dashboard provides two core functionalities:

1. Add User (Enrollment): Allows an administrator to enroll a new authorized user by entering their name and capturing their facial biometrics via a connected webcam. This process creates the necessary data for the system's face detection logic.

2. View Users (Management): Displays a list of all currently authorized users. This section includes an "Actions" column with a "Remove" button, enabling the administrator to easily de-authorize and delete a user's face data from the system when necessary.

This dashboard is the essential control panel for setting up the user base, defining the authorized user identity, and enabling the project's core function: intelligently adapting screen security based on the real-time presence of a trusted individual.
